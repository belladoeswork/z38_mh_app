Code Style and Structure:
- Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) over class components.
- Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- Use consistent styling
- Responsive Design: Ensure your design adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. Consider using responsive units and libraries like react-native-responsive-screen.
- Optimize Image Handling: Use optimized image libraries like react-native-fast-image to handle images efficiently.
- Ensure a React component is exported as default.
